comment,4s0uSmECs50,Pangolin: Kulu‚Äôs Journey | Official Trailer | Netflix,Netflix,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4s0uSmECs50,@ruthy6150,I have fallen in love with Kulu what a lovely little harmless creature. Because of kulu I now donate to the pangolin man to help re educate the former poachers and natives in the area. That is one way to help them thrive. I have a car sticker and a tee shirt with pangolins on and get lots of enquiries about what are pangolins. It‚Äôs a bit of help in an area where I can never hope to see a pangolin (England) but people can be touched by this amazing creature and his story and may be moved to help.,,poach

Just like Kulu, she had been rescued from poachers. She was the sweetest, most angelic  little soul. They really are adorable little beings with such characters. It was an honour, taking her out for her forages around the game reserve we lived in. She was eventually given to a pangolin sanctuary and successfully rewilded. I always will treasure our time with her. ü§çüíõüôèüèªüôèüèªüòáüòáüáøüáºüáøüáº",,poach

Nothing about the trackpad is good or decent. It's inconsistent, it sounds cheap, looks cheap, feels cheap, works cheap, honestly it feels like what a toy trackpad would feel like if that were a thing. 2. The keyboard has a ton of flex. It looks a lot nicer than it feels. 3. The 6 hours of battery life is more like 2-3. 4. Suspend uses as much battery as just leaving the laptop open and awake. At first I thought it wasn't going into a suspend state, but journalctl says it was - but it was still burning enough battery that it was dead in the morning. This was true in Pop!_OS and Linux Mint 22.1 Beta, which were the only two distros I tried that were able to detect the bluetooth card (this was a few days before LM 22.1 was released - 22.0 didn't work with the bluetooth). I suspect this is a Debian/Ubuntu issue, see below. 5. The USB-C port was loose. It was 50/50 whether or not the laptop was charging at any given time.  I returned mine and replaced it with a Thinkpad E16 Gen 2, which was $300 less for similar memory/storage options, and dare I say a slightly snappier processor. The Thinkpad also had power management issues related to suspend while running Linux Mint 22.1, which disappeared after I installed Fedora 41.  Luckily System76 has a great return policy. If you do buy this, be gentle with it and save all of the packaging.",6234221221,

The ""new"" Pangolin is using a previous generation 8945HS (which is a decent processor mind you). The latest chip in this class is of course the HX370 which is superior in every way. My guess is they can't move all those Intel machines they put out a few years ago because... well you know why. As a result they have to make their next gen lineup as cheap as possible and probably got a good deal on these older chips. They used to have like one or two token AMD machines with clearly inferior specs than their Intel machines and now they're stuck with an overstock. It's kind of sad to see such a mistake from a good company like this. I hope it doesn't happen again.",,deal
